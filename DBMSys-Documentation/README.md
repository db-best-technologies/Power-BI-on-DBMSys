# Folder to capture DBMSys schema information
We'll use md files and SQL files to document DBMSys schema objects needed for Power BI. For any SQL files, 
there should be a corresponding .MD file that describes the schema. 
  
For starters, we can take CREATE TABLE statements and add comments to them. In addition, it would help to have associated .CSV files
with sample data to help in understanding objects.
