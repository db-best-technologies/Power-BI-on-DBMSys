# Using Power BI on DBMSys
This repository supports the extension of DBMSys to sopport common DMO scenarios to help solution architects
and customers understand their environment.
## Folder structure
- **DBMSys-Queries.** Contains working SQL queries for exploring the DBMSys database. Once we think a query should be part of
the base set of functionality, they will go into the Workflow-Scripts folder.
- **Workflow-Scripts.** Contains SQL, PowerShell, and other scripts to support customer engagements.
- **DBMSys-Documentation.** Includes files to document the DBMSys database to make it easier for building Power-BI models.
- **Example-DMO-Reports.** Contains current DMO reports from different engagements as the foundation for the Power BI analysis.
if also useful to identify a lack of capabilities that this repository hopes to remedy.
- **Power-BI-Reports.** Contains a basic template used for analyzing the existing DMO output with modifications to make it useful
in presenting data directly to the customer. This folder will eventually contain a set of DBBest-Offer-Presales-Master-Report 
used for demonstrations and pre-sales engagements.
- **Offer-Supplimental-Files.** Includes standard Excel documents that are used to extend the DBMSys user interface so that 
we can get additional information not stored in DBMSys from the customer.
